                            <p className="card-text">Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles,
                                California. Its name has come to be a shorthand reference for the U.S. film industry, and
                                the people associated with it. Many of its studios such as Disney, Paramount Pictures,
                                Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures were founded there; Paramount still has its studios
                                there.
                                
                                Hollywood was incorporated as a municipality in 1903. It was consolidated with the
                                city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry emerged,
                                eventually becoming the most recognizable in the world.</p>
